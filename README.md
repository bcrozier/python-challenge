# PyBank

To start you unzip the files from GitLab save them and import os and CSV
From there you create a path from the data to the code, allowing for the code to apply to the specific data we want

The variables were defined as I went through the challenge, not all at the beginning, I had a lot of help from my tutors keeping me focused on the correct next calculation I needed to make 

Use with open to set to csv reader and then skip the first row that says "Dat,Profit/Losses"

Next was to calculate the change in profit/losses. You need to start on Feb-10 because we don't have any data prior to Jan-10 to calculate a profit/loss

Next run 2 if statements to to calculate the greatest increase and greatest decrease

finally f statement to print the output.txt file.
